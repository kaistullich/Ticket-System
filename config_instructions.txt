Before filling out the information you will need to start up the `ngrok` HTTPS forwarder. To do this
go into the folder where you installed `ngrok` inside and *UNZIPPED* it. You need to use your Terminal (MacOSX) or
CMD (Windows) to do this.

From within that directory use the following commands to start `ngrok` on PORT 5000

    $ ./ngrok http 5000

This will start a new screen. Inside of the screen you should see 2 "Forwarding" urls, we will be using the HTTPS
url.


After completing the previous steps fill in the blanks with the following information:

    1.  "MAIL_USERNAME" = the Gmail address that you created or any Gmail address you have permission to
    2.  "MAIL_PASSWORD" = the password to that Gmail account
    3.  "account_sid" = the account SID from Twilio. It is inside of your Developer Console home page
    4.  "auth_token" = the account auth token from Twilio. It is inside of your Developer Console home page
    5.  "from_" = the Twilio phone number assigned to your account. You will have to create this (https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming)
    6.  "dept_num" = any phone number that you are able to receive incoming calls from (i.e. cellphone, home phone, work phone etc.)
    7.  "reminder" = the `ngrok` HTTPS url with the /reminder route on PORT 5000 (i.e. https://7221d98b.ngrok.io/reminder)
    8.  "ticket_creation" = the `ngrok` HTTPS url with the /ticket_creation route on PORT 5000 (i.e. https://7221d98b.ngrok.io/ticket_creation)
    9.  "api_url" = the `ngrok` HTTPS url with the /api/tickets route on PORT 5000 (i.e. https://7221d98b.ngrok.io/api/tickets)

With all those values set, the `config.json` file is complete.
